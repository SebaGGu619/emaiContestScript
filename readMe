Hello and welcome to the readMe!

The csv file should contain as many lines as you want but it HAS to contain 6 columns with the following information:

Account Code, Sales Name, ELS, Discount, Destination Address, CC Address

Also no spaces between the data and the commas.
Example: NOT GOOD: 12345 , Dave John , ...
             GOOD: 12345,Dave John, ...

After that make sure to add your credentials and start the script!

Don't forget to install the requirements from the file!

Thanks for the read!
